# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
This project uses machine learning to analyze data to predict which funding applicants will outperform their grants.

## Overview ##
The client wants to create a more effective method of evaluating grant applications. They want to predict the applicant's success in achieving their outlined goals if they receive the grant. I am using Tensorflow and Neural Network machine learning to evaluate these applicants. My goal is to achieve an accuracy rate above 75%.
